This file shows sequenes made to build the HW3 mock-figure. 

The data from this file was downloaded from BLAST on 4/6 and 4/7. 

The common name of each search and thier accession numbers used for BLAST are:

JIP3: Q9UPT6

JIP1: Q9UQF2

Sarm1: Q6SZW1.1

MAPK9: P45984.2

MAPK8: P45983

Hemoglobin: P69905

These sequences were selected based on my limited knowledge on JIP3 and other neurodegeneration proteins. The second iteration will have more input on each entry and more reasoning behind their selection.
